    "## Model Selection: SARIMA\n",
    "\n",
    "SARIMA, or Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, is an extension of the ARIMA model that specifically includes components for seasonality. The justification for selecting SARIMA for the half-hourly energy demand time series in Victoria, Australia, is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Characteristics\n",
    "- **Stationarity**: The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test confirmed that the time series is stationary, which is a prerequisite for ARIMA-based models.\n",
    "- **Seasonality**: The time series decomposition and Fourier analysis revealed clear seasonal patterns, which SARIMA can model with its seasonal parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Capabilities\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: SARIMA's flexibility allows it to model a broad class of seasonal time series.\n",
    "- **Seasonal Parameters**: It includes seasonal autoregressive (P), differencing (D), and moving average (Q) parameters along with a period (s) parameter to explicitly model the seasonality observed in the data.\n",
    "- **Interpretability**: SARIMA models provide interpretable parameters that correspond to the data's autocorrelations and partial autocorrelations, making them favorable for understanding the driving forces behind the time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predictive Performance\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: SARIMA models are known for their accuracy in forecasting time series data with seasonal patterns.\n",
    "- **Adaptability**: They can be tuned to adapt to changes in the time series' structure over time, accommodating evolving trends and seasonal effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these points, SARIMA is a well-suited model for forecasting the energy demand time series and will be the primary focus in the next phase of our analysis.\n"

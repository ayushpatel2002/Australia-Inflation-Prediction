  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>The objective of this project is to dissect and understand the time series data representing the half-hourly energy demand in Victoria, Australia. Our aim is to extract meaningful patterns and statistics that will enable us to forecast future demand with high accuracy.</p>
  
  <h2>Key Findings</h2>
  
  <h3>1. Time Series Decomposition</h3>
  <p>We applied classical decomposition methods to separate the time series into its constituent components:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Trend</strong>: The trend component exhibited a cyclical behavior, hinting at underlying influences such as economic activities or seasonal weather variations that affect energy usage over time.</li>
    <li><strong>Seasonality</strong>: We observed pronounced seasonality within a three-month period, which aligns with the typical climatic seasons in Australia, suggesting a strong seasonal influence on energy consumption patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Residuals</strong>: The residuals, which capture the irregular or random variations in the data after the trend and seasonal components have been accounted for, revealed additional complexity that may include outliers or non-systematic fluctuations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test</h3>
  <p>The ADF test was employed to ascertain the stationarity of the time series:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The test returned a very low p-value, indicating strong evidence against the null hypothesis of a unit root, thus confirming the <strong>stationarity</strong> of the series. This implies that the data is suitable for modeling without the need for differencing to stabilize the mean.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Fourier Analysis</h3>
  <p>Fourier analysis was utilized to transform the time series into the frequency domain, revealing the power spectrum of the data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The analysis uncovered a range of frequencies with significant amplitudes, pointing to the existence of multiple underlying seasonal cycles in the data. This complexity provides a nuanced understanding of the temporal dynamics at play in energy demand.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Visual Inspection</h3>
  <p>Direct visual examination of the data was conducted to validate the analytical findings:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reviewing the raw time series alongside the rolling mean and standard deviation, we found no evidence of a long-term trend, reinforcing the stationarity indicated by the ADF test.</li>
    <li>The decomposition plots, particularly for the three-monthly seasonality, corroborated the seasonal patterns that were consistent with the known energy demand fluctuations in Victoria.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Through a multi-faceted analysis—encompassing decomposition, statistical testing, and frequency domain analysis—we established that the time series is stationary and features significant seasonality. These insights inform our subsequent model selection and forecasting efforts, ensuring that the chosen models can aptly capture and predict the identified patterns.</p>
  
  <h2>Next Steps</h2>
  <p>Building on these foundational insights, we will proceed to develop and fine-tune forecasting models that integrate the seasonal components. The goal is to predict future energy demand with enhanced precision, taking into account the distinct seasonal influences that characterize the energy usage in Victoria, Australia.</p>

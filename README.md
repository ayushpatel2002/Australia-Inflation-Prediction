# Australian Electricity Demand Forecasting Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting the half-hourly electricity consumption of Australian states from 2002 to 2015. Using time series forecasting techniques, we aim to predict energy consumption for subsequent years and compare the forecasts with actual data post-2015.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Godahewa, R. (2021). "Australian Electricity Demand Dataset". Zenodo. [DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.4659727](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4659727).
- **Description**: The dataset includes half-hourly electricity demand data for various Australian states, spanning from 2002 to 2015.

## Objectives
1. Analyze historical electricity demand patterns.
2. Develop and validate time series forecasting models.
3. Predict future electricity consumption for the years following 2015.
4. Compare predictions with actual demand data post-2015 to evaluate forecasting accuracy.

## Methodology
- Time series analysis and forecasting methods (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM).
- Data pre-processing and exploratory analysis to understand demand patterns and influential factors.
- Model training, tuning, and validation.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python for data analysis and machine learning.
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository.
- Install required Python libraries.
- Run the Jupyter notebooks for analysis and model training.

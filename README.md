# Australian Inflation Rate Time Series Forecasting

This repository contains the data, code, and analysis for forecasting the Australian inflation rate using time series data. The project aims to build a predictive model to understand the trends and patterns in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for Australia.

## Project Overview

The inflation rate is a crucial economic indicator that reflects the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and subsequently, how it affects the purchasing power of currency. This project uses historical CPI data to forecast future inflation trends in Australia.

## Data Source

The primary dataset used in this project is the Consumer Price Index (CPI) provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The data includes CPI index numbers and percentage changes across different capital cities and the entire country.

## Methodology

The project employs various time series analysis techniques, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and machine learning approaches, to model and predict inflation rates.

## Usage

The main analysis can be found in the Jupyter notebooks within this repository. These notebooks contain step-by-step instructions and code to perform the time series forecasting.
